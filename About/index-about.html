    <h2>About MAGENHA <br> [This page is under construction!]</h2>

    <h3>Motivation</h3>
    <p>
        This is a non-profit project whose purpose is to serve as a research tool for historians, genetists 
        and genealogists. Aims to merge monoparental inheritance DNA with genealogy in order to re-construct 
        past populations history and genetics. The novelty of it is that it will allow users from different 
        companies (23andme, FTDNA, Ancestry, MyHeritage, tellmeGen, etc.) to coincide in the same site that 
        will favor the investigation of their paternal and maternal lines. It is mostly focused on Cuban and 
        Spanish genealogies, but recent research on Nicaraguan roots is in the works. 
    </p>
    <p>
    The objective of this project is to create a publicly available database of haplogroups (mitochondrial
    and Y) to enrich genealogical and historical research. Said database will contain the genealogical
    information of the corresponding line of propagation. The haplogroups will be mainly the results of
    genetic tests that volunteers will report, being born (or 100% descendants of people born in) Cuba,
    the Canary Islands and Spain in general, given the related history of these three places. It is planned
    to set up a digital platform so that users can see the research in progress, contribute, and promote
    scientific research related to their haplogroups.

        <h2>How can people help?</h2>

        <p>
            The greatest contribution that each future user will be able to make will 
            be the product of their genealogical research. For the moment, MAGENHA exhorts 
            to intensify the investigation of the paternal and maternal lines. A better 
            understanding of paternal and maternal haplogroups is also encouraged, which 
            will be available on the website in the next days. If you want more personalized 
            help in this regard, contact MAGENHA and they will try to guide you.
        </p>

        <h2>What is being done by MAGENHA in the field of genetics?</h2>

        <p>
            DNA tests are being carried out on volunteers from Cuba and Nicaragua. They have 
            been selected for carrying haplogroups of interest to the genetic diversity of the 
            project: african roots, native-american roots, representative linages of certain 
            region, and so on. Recently, the process of examining a descendant of Guantanamo, 
            Cuba families, two cuban Afro-descendants, a natural person from Holguin, Cuba 
            carrying a representative linage and a few testers from Leon, Nicaragua. As a first 
            step, the FamilyFinder test offered by Family Tree DNA (FTDNA) is carried out, and 
            later the analysis of mitochondrial DNA or Y chromosome is entrusted to said sample
             as resources are obtained for them by donations.
        </p>

        <h2>What is being done in the field of genealogy?</h2>
        <p>
            A group of members in Cuba, Nicaragua & Spain are accessing different documentary 
            sources, in order to create a modest database for the project. The same, in the future, 
            will guide some genealogical lines that are difficult to access for users who require it. 
            These members recommend potential volunteers for DNA testing and are responsible for 
            assisting with the procedure on the ground.

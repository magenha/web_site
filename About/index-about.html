    <h2>Motivation</h2>
    <p>
        The study of monoparental DNA in species has helped to better understand their origins and migrations 
        on our planet, which is why it has received great importance from natural, exact and social sciences. This DNA differs from autosomal DNA, in that the second consists of a mixture of the DNA of 
    the parents, while the first is inherited entirely from only one of the parents. In humans, a DNA located
    in the cellular mitochondria is inherited, whose origin is maternal, that is, an individual inherits the
    entire mitochondrial DNA (mt-DNA) from its mother. Idem, if at birth the person carries a Y
    chromosome, it will be exactly the same as the Y chromosome of their male parent. There are
    various types of Y chromosome, and mt-DNA, being classified with haplogroups, that in some
    cases are identifying certain human populations of different historical periods. A recent and concrete
    example of the link between genetic genealogy and history was in the identification of the remains of
    King Richard III of England, in 2014.

    The objective of this project is to create a publicly available database of haplogroups (mitochondrial
    and Y) to enrich genealogical and historical research. Said database will contain the genealogical
    information of the corresponding line of propagation. The haplogroups will be mainly the results of
    genetic tests that volunteers will report, being born (or 100% descendants of people born in) Cuba,
    the Canary Islands and Spain in general, given the related history of these three places. It is planned
    to set up a digital platform so that users can see the research in progress, contribute, and promote
    scientific research related to their haplogroups.

    <h2>Preliminary results</h2>

    <h2>Projections of future work</h2>
    <p>
        This work can help resolve dilemmas of the ethnic origin of people who lived in times for which
        there is not much documentation. Such is the case of Ana Zabala and del Castillo, whose maternal
        line descends from families that settled in G ̈uines and Catalina de G ̈uines (15; 16), both towns in what
        is now the Mayabeque province in Cuba. The said Ana Zabala is referred to as “natural woman of
        this” (referring to Cuba), which has left several researchers wondering if it was a person descended
        from Native Americans or simply a Creole daughter of Europeans (16). A genealogical development
        and a DNA test to some descendant of the maternal line could help to clarify this issue. In the same
        way, it is possible to try to confirm maternal lines descendants of Elvira Lasso de la Vega, one of the
        wives of Vasco Porcayo, who has been written with little documentation that she was the daughter
        of T ́ınima, daughter in turn of the cacique Camag ̈uebax, which would give a stronger closure to this
        genealogy (15; 16).
        The ethnic origins of surnames with a single root can be studied. In Cuba we can find the Basallo
        (originally from Galicia), the Cepero (from Burgos), the Facenda (originally from Tenerife, main
        settlers of San Jos ́e de las Lajas), Lima (Portugal), among so many families that are found in the
        studies of genealogy that have been carried out from the 20th century to the present day (15; 17–19).
        An immediate objective of the project is to investigate and consult with researchers from the Canary
        Islands about possible lines of interest to which the project can contribute

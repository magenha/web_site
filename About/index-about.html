    <h2>About MAGENHA <br> [This page is under construction!]</h2>

    <h3>Motivation</h3>
    <p>
        This project is justified for some reasons:
        <ul>

            <li>There is no database like the one we propose. At the user level, DNA programs (23andMe, Ancestry, Gedmatch, My Heritage) are based on autosomal results and the haplogroup information present in Family Tree DNA is expensive and therefore very limited in number since few people they choose to pay what it costs.</li>
            <li>Users have the possibility to expand their trees if they share information with other users of the same haplogroup.</li>
            <li>The demographic study of haplogroups in the target regions will expand our knowledge about that population and its history.</li>
        </ul>


 
    </p>
    <p>
    The objective of this project is to create a publicly available database of haplogroups (mitochondrial
    and Y) to enrich genealogical and historical research. Said database will contain the genealogical
    information of the corresponding line of propagation. The haplogroups will be mainly the results of
    genetic tests that volunteers will report, being born (or 100% descendants of people born in) Cuba,
    the Canary Islands and Spain in general, given the related history of these three places. It is planned
    to set up a digital platform so that users can see the research in progress, contribute, and promote
    scientific research related to their haplogroups.

        <h2>How can people help?</h2>

        <p>
            
            If a person has taken a test on 23andme, can donate his/her <a href="https://whoareyoumadeof.com/blog/how-to-download-23andme-dna-relatives/">DNA relatives list</a> (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5rBaJUGyOM&ab_channel=YourDNAGuide">see this video to learn download relatives list</a>). That will help us compute some 
            statistical results, like the ones in <a href="../Resources/index-resources.html">RESOURCES</a>. 
            There is no personal information in the file, nor from the relatives. Our focus is the grandparent's country of birth and haplogrup of the relatives. Once we extract the information, we delete the file.
            If you are willing to donate your relatives list, please <a href="../Contact/index-contact.html">contact us</a> . 
            
            If a person wants to be a user of the project, and does not know their haplogroups, there are several options. <br>
            <ul>
                <li>If the person has taken tests on MyHeritage or Ancestry, and has a Y chromosome, the MAGENHA platform will have a genetic calculator that can predict the paternal haplogroup. In the same way, the alternative use of other pages that do the same, such as Caldefinder.ysqeq, will be suggested. In this case, the project does not store the file that the user submits, it only parses it and saves the result.</li>
                <li>If the person has not had a DNA test, they can be given a recommendation on which one to take.</li>
                <li>If the person has not taken a DNA test because it is economically and geographically impossible, they will be considered as an active volunteer. In this case, the project will try to provide you with an FTDNA DNA kit to analyze your haplogroups, but this plan is not being carried out at the moment. Requests for this case must be duly justified and analyzed by the project managers prior to their approval or denial.</li>
            </ul>
            In any case, <a href="../Contact/index-contact.html">contact us</a> .

   <h2 id="genealogy good practices">Genealogy good practices</h2> 
    <p>Genealogical research, also known as genealogy, is an exciting quest to discover and preserve the history of our ancestors and their family connections. Through genealogical research, we can reconstruct the past, understand our roots, and connect with our cultural heritage.
        However, the task of tracing genealogy can be challenging and requires proper techniques to obtain accurate and reliable results. In this introduction, we will explore some good practices and suggestions that will help us meet the challenges of genealogy research efficiently and effectively.
        From the use of historical sources and official records to the application of DNA genetic analysis, these techniques will allow us to enrich our understanding of our family roots and honor the memory of those who preceded us. A methodical approach and a persevering attitude will open the doors to an exciting journey through time and the history of our family. Let's discover together the key tools and strategies that will lead us on an exciting and enriching genealogy journey.
        </p>
    <h2 id="sources of research">Sources of research</h2>
    <p>Reference sources for genealogy can be classified into two main categories: primary sources and secondary sources. Each of them is explained below:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Primary Sources: Primary sources are original records that provide firsthand information about events and people. These documents are created contemporaneously with the events they describe. They are considered the most reliable sources for genealogical research. Some examples of primary sources include:</li>
        <ol>
            <li>
                
Birth, marriage and death certificates.
            </li>
            <li>
                Parish and church records.
            </li>
            <li>
                
Official censuses.
            </li>
            <li>
                Wills and legal documents.
            </li>
            <li>
                Original letters, diaries and photographs.
            </li>
            <li>Interviews with relatives and people who lived through the events.</li>
        </ol>
        <li>Secondary Sources: Secondary sources are records that are not directly related to the events or people in question, but are based on information provided by primary sources or on interpretations and compilations of genealogical data. Although they can be useful as guides or clues, they should be considered less reliable than primary sources. Some examples of secondary sources include:</li>
        <ol>
            <li>Genealogy books and family biographies written by other researchers.</li>
            <li>Genealogy web pages that cite primary sources, but do not provide the original documents</li>
            <li>Online databases with information compiled from various genealogical sources.</li>
        </ol>
    </ol>
    
    <p>It is important to use both primary and secondary sources in genealogical research. Primary sources offer more accurate and authentic data, while secondary sources can help uncover new lines of inquiry and provide additional historical context. By combining both, a more complete and accurate picture of family history can be obtained. 
        On our website there are references to the essential primary and secondary sources for different countries. (<a href="./index-sources.html">link</a>)</p>
    
    <p>Depending on the country and its history, genealogical sources may vary. Some countries may have extensive and well-preserved records, while in others, the lack of records or the destruction of files due to historical events can present research challenges.
    </p>
    
    <p>Since each country has its own history and context, it is important to adapt the research methodology to the particularities of the specific region you are investigating. This may include the use of different languages, familiarization with local administrative systems, and understanding of historical events that may have affected record keeping. In addition, having local collaborators and genealogy experts from the region can be of great help for successful research in different Latin American countries.
